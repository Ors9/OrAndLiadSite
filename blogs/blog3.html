    <h1>🐶 Puppy Training 101</h1>

    <p>Welcoming a new puppy is exciting — but also a big responsibility. Early training helps build good behavior and strengthens your bond.</p>

    <h2>🏠 Housebreaking Basics</h2>
    <p>Start potty training as early as possible. Take your pup out after eating, sleeping, or playing. Be patient and consistent — praise works better than punishment.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ Basic Commands</h2>
    <p>Teach simple commands like <strong>"sit"</strong>, <strong>"stay"</strong>, and <strong>"come"</strong> using treats and repetition. Keep training sessions short (5–10 minutes) and fun.</p>

    <h2>🐕 Socialization</h2>
    <p>Expose your puppy to different people, dogs, and environments early on. This helps prevent fear and aggression later in life.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Keep It Positive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use rewards like treats, toys, or affection.</li>
      <li>Never yell or hit — it creates fear and confusion.</li>
      <li>Stay calm and patient, even if mistakes happen.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Early training sets the foundation for a happy, well-behaved dog. Keep things positive and consistent, and your pup will thrive!</p>
