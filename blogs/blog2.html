    <h1>🍖 5 Superfoods Your Dog Will Love</h1>

    <p>Looking for a way to boost your dog’s health? These 5 dog-friendly superfoods are safe, delicious, and full of nutrients your pup will love.</p>

    <h2>1. 🫐 Blueberries</h2>
    <p>Rich in antioxidants, fiber, and vitamins C & K, blueberries are a healthy treat in moderation. Try freezing them on hot days!</p>

    <h2>2. 🥕 Carrots</h2>
    <p>Great for your dog’s teeth and eyesight, carrots are low in calories and high in fiber and beta-carotene.</p>

    <h2>3. 🐟 Salmon</h2>
    <p>Cooked salmon is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which promote a healthy coat, skin, and brain function.</p>

    <h2>4. 🍌 Bananas</h2>
    <p>Full of potassium and fiber, bananas are a sweet and soft snack your dog will enjoy — but keep servings small due to sugar.</p>

    <h2>5. 🥬 Spinach</h2>
    <p>Spinach is packed with iron and antioxidants. Lightly steam it before serving, and use it as a topper on your dog’s meal.</p>
