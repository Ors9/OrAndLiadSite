    <h1>🦷 Dental Care for Dogs Made Simple</h1>
    <p>Good dental health is key to your dog's overall well-being. Neglecting it can lead to bad breath, gum disease, and even organ damage.</p>

    <h2>🪥 Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Oral bacteria can travel through the bloodstream and affect the heart, liver, and kidneys. That’s why regular dental care is essential.</p>

    <h2>🧴 At-Home Care Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Brush your dog’s teeth several times a week with a dog-specific toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Use dental chews or treats approved by vets.</li>
      <li>Provide chew toys that help reduce tartar buildup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>👩‍⚕️ When to See a Vet</h2>
    <p>Schedule professional cleanings as recommended. Watch for signs like bad breath, red gums, or difficulty eating.</p>
