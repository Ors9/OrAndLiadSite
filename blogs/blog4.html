    <h1>🏠 Creating the Perfect Dog-Friendly Home</h1>

    <p>Your home should be a safe, comfortable place for your dog to thrive. With a few thoughtful adjustments, you can make it both beautiful and pup-friendly.</p>

    <h2>🛋️ Safe Spaces</h2>
    <p>Designate a cozy corner or bed area just for your dog. It helps them feel secure and gives them a place to rest when things get busy.</p>

    <h2>🍽️ Food & Water Zones</h2>
    <p>Set up clean, easily accessible spots for food and water. Use mats to catch spills and choose bowls that are the right size for your dog.</p>

    <h2>🚫 Dog-Proofing Essentials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep wires, medications, and cleaning supplies out of reach.</li>
      <li>Use baby gates if needed to limit access to certain rooms.</li>
      <li>Secure trash cans and food storage areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🐕 Play and Enrichment</h2>
    <p>Provide plenty of toys, puzzle feeders, and chew options. Mental stimulation is just as important as physical activity.</p>

    <p>A dog-friendly home doesn’t require a full renovation. With small changes and a little planning, you’ll create a space where your pup can feel truly at home.</p>
