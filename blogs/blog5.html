    <h1>🚶 Daily Walks: How Long is Enough?</h1>

    <p>Walks aren’t just for bathroom breaks — they’re essential for your dog’s physical and mental well-being. But how much walking does your dog really need?</p>

    <h2>🐾 General Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Most dogs benefit from 30 minutes to 2 hours of walking per day, depending on age, breed, and health.</p>

    <h2>📏 Factors That Matter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breed:</strong> High-energy breeds (like Border Collies or Huskies) may need more exercise.</li>
      <li><strong>Age:</strong> Puppies and seniors often need shorter, more frequent walks.</li>
      <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Adjust walk time in hot or cold conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎾 Make Walks Enriching</h2>
    <p>Let your dog sniff and explore. Bring toys, use varied routes, and incorporate basic training for mental stimulation.</p>

    <p>Consistency is key! Even short, daily walks help reduce anxiety, manage weight, and strengthen your bond.</p>
