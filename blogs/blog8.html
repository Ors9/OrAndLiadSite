    <h1>🐾 Understanding Dog Body Language</h1>
    <p>Your dog is constantly "talking" — you just need to learn how to listen. Understanding body language helps build trust and prevent misunderstandings.</p>

    <h2>👀 Eyes, Ears, and Tail</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relaxed eyes and ears usually signal a calm dog.</li>
      <li>Pinned ears or a tucked tail can indicate fear or submission.</li>
      <li>Stiff posture or a high, wagging tail may show alertness or arousal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🐕 Common Signals</h2>
    <p>Yawning and lip licking can be signs of stress. Play bows invite fun, while growling means “back off.”</p>

    <h2>🤝 Build Better Communication</h2>
    <p>Pay attention to context and combine body language with vocal cues. Your awareness helps keep interactions positive and safe.</p>
