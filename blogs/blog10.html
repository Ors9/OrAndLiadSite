    <h1>💤 Dog Sleep 101: How Much Rest Do They Need?</h1>
    <p>Dogs sleep a lot more than humans — and that’s perfectly normal! But how much is enough, and what affects their sleep habits?</p>

    <h2>⏱️ Typical Sleep Needs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Puppies: up to 18–20 hours/day</li>
      <li>Adult dogs: 12–14 hours/day</li>
      <li>Seniors: often more than 14 hours/day</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛏️ Creating a Sleep-Friendly Space</h2>
    <p>Provide a quiet, cozy bed in a draft-free spot. Avoid disruptions and maintain a consistent routine.</p>

    <h2>⚠️ Signs of Sleep Issues</h2>
    <p>Excessive restlessness, loud snoring, or frequent wake-ups may signal discomfort or health issues. Talk to your vet if you're concerned.</p>
